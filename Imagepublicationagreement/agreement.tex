\addchap{Publication of an image as part of this project}
With this document I confirm to the OpenMTLcalendar project and possible successor projects and the companies that want to print, distribute and use the OpenMTLcalendar that the image and myself meet the following criteria.
\begin{contract}
	\Paragraph{title={Author}}
	I am the author or photographer of the submitted image or artistic representation. I have not taken the picture on behalf of a company, organization or other legal person. Furthermore, I have not granted any company, organization or other legal entity exclusive rights to this image.
	
	\Paragraph{title={Use of the image}}
	I am aware that the work of this project is under CC-BY-SA license. Using the image does not give me any financial advantage and others may well pursue a profit-making intention with it without my objection. Under the conditions mentioned in the license, this can also be done in other projects.
	
	\Paragraph{title={Attribution}}
	I am aware that my full name or a pseudonym is required for any use of my submitted image. This results from the project license selection. In the process of image transmission, I will provide this information. A name change is not possible through the history in the version management. In addition, it is difficult to determine whether a person is still the same, since we do not have any identity features. Even a key for the digital signature can be stolen. I am aware that the project therefore refrains from subsequent name changes.
	
	\Paragraph{title={12 months agreement}}
	I am aware that a year has only 12 months. Therefore, my contribution is not visible in every calendar. I am also aware that the displays used can be changed at any time. The assignment of the months to the images is also unrestricted. Meine Erlaubnis ist dafür nicht nötig.
\end{contract}
